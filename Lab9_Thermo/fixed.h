Option 1 (have a board, will debug with OLED output). Lab1.c is not real useful for this approach
void Fixed_uDecOut2(unsigned long n);
void Fixed_sDecOut3(long n);
void Fixed_uBinOut8(unsigned long n); 

Option 2 (do not have board and will test in the simulator). See lab1.c for an example of how to test
void Fixed_uDecOut2s(unsigned long n,  char *string);
void Fixed_sDecOut3s(long n, char *string);
void Fixed_uBinOut8s(unsigned long n,  char *string); 

The difference in the options will be option 1 uses printf, and option 2 uses sprintf. Both have the OLED as the starter project.

/****************Fixed_uDecOut2s***************
 converts fixed point number to ASCII string
 format unsigned 32-bit with resolution 0.01
 range 0 to 999.99
 Input: unsigned 32-bit integer part of fixed point number
         greater than 99999 means invalid fixed-point number
 Output: null-terminated string exactly 6 characters plus null
 Examples
 12345 to "123.45"  
 22100 to "221.00"
   102 to "  1.02" 
    31 to "  0.31"

/**************Fixed_uBinOut8s***************
 unsigned 32-bit binary fixed-point with a resolution of 1/256. 
 The full-scale range is from 0 to 999.99. 
 If the integer part is larger than 256000, it signifies an error. 
 The Fixed_uBinOut8 function takes an unsigned 32-bit integer part 
 of the binary fixed-point number and outputs the fixed-point value on the OLED. 
 Input: unsigned 32-bit integer part of fixed point number
 Output: null-terminated string
